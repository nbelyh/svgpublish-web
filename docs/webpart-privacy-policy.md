# SvgPublish web part privacy policy

Last updated August 15, 2025

Your privacy is important. This document explains what information the SvgPublish web part for SharePoint may collect, how that information is used, and how you can contact us about it.

Summary

- Customer content and diagram data handled by the SvgPublish web part remains inside the customer's Microsoft 365 tenant and is not stored or transmitted outside the tenant by the web part itself.
- The web part does not collect personal information by default. The only personal data that may be processed is information you explicitly provide when requesting support.
- We may collect anonymous telemetry (application errors and usage statistics) using Azure Application Insights (App Insights) to improve reliability and quality. This is optional and does not include any content from your diagrams. Telemetry stored in App Insights is retained for a maximum of 60 days.

## What data do we collect?

- Support contact information: If you contact us for support we may collect the personal information you provide (for example: name, email address, phone number) in order to respond to and track your request.
- Anonymous telemetry: We may collect anonymized diagnostic and usage data (such as crash reports and feature usage) to help improve the product. Telemetry does not include the actual content of your diagrams.

## How do we collect data?

- Support: When you email or call support, you provide contact details and any information you choose to share about the issue. We store that support correspondence to investigate and resolve the issue.
- Telemetry: If enabled, telemetry is collected from the running web part using Azure Application Insights (App Insights). Any telemetry we collect is limited to technical and usage metrics and does not include diagram content.
- Website analytics: If you visit our public documentation site, that site may use analytics (for example Google Analytics). That is covered by the website's privacy policy.

## How will we use your data?

We use the information only for the following purposes:

- To respond to and manage support requests.
- To diagnose, fix, and prevent product defects by using anonymized error reports and usage statistics.
- To improve product features and reliability based on aggregate usage data.

## How we store your data

Support correspondence and personal information you provide directly to us are stored securely and retained only as long as necessary to handle the support case (by default we retain support emails for up to 2 years). Telemetry data collected in Azure Application Insights is retained for a maximum of 60 days. We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect stored data.

## Marketing

We will not send you marketing emails unless you explicitly opt in.

## Sharing personal information

We will not sell, rent, or otherwise share personal information with third parties except as required by law or to comply with legal process.

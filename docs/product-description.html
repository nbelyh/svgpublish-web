<h2 id="svg-publish-sharepoint-web-part">SVG Publish SharePoint Web Part</h2>
<hr>
<p>This package contains a SharePoint Framework (SPFx) Web Part that creates interactive web presentations from SVG diagrams exported from Microsoft Visio.</p>
<p>The web part allows embedding interactive SVG diagrams into modern SharePoint pages with rich functionality including pan, zoom, hyperlinks, tooltips, layers, shape selection, and comprehensive navigation features. It provides enhanced interactivity and customization options specifically designed for Visio-exported SVG files.</p>
<p>One of the key capabilities is the sophisticated shape interaction system, enabling users to select shapes, view detailed properties, and navigate through connected diagram elements. This makes it ideal for complex process flows, organizational charts, technical diagrams, and any scenario requiring detailed shape-level interaction.</p>
<p>The web part supports multiple display modes including fullscreen presentation, embedded views, and responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes. Advanced features include layer management for controlling diagram visibility, customizable toolbars, and flexible navigation options that can be tailored to specific use cases.</p>
<p>Additional functionality includes support for hyperlinks within diagrams, shape property tooltips that display metadata, search capabilities across diagram content, and the ability to highlight specific shapes or regions. The solution supports custom content within shapes and provides a configurable sidebar for additional information display. Options are also available for customizing the user interface to match organizational branding and presentation requirements.</p>
